  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  
  <p>
  In the following, you will see the results of a regression analysis that regresses the various above mentioned factors on the productivity score we introduced here. As the productivity score consists of 200 items, which will lead to a large range of values in our sample, we assume the index to be a metric variable. Thus, the method of choice will be OLS regression.

  Let us see the results.
